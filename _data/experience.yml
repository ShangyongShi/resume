  summary: In this project, we aimed at improving the machine learning algorithm to improve orographic snowfall retrieval from microwave sensors. We are looking for proper variables that can well catch the characteristics of orographci snowfall, especially in the Great Lakes and the Appalachian mountains. <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Tested the performance of the orographci precipitation index in identifying orographic snowfall.</li><li>Discovered a positive correlation between the orographic precipitation index and the snowfall rate bias</li><li>Currently working on finding a better combination of features for orographic snowfall identification</li></ul>
